        <h2>Characteristic Instruments of Classical Music</h2>

                <h3>String Instruments</h3>
                <p>Strings play an essential role in classical orchestras. Violins, violas, cellos, and double basses are used for rich and expressive sounds.</p>
                <img src="violon.png" alt="violin, viola, cello, double bass in classical music" width="50%" height="100%">
                <p>These four instruments each have unique characteristics. For example, the smaller the instrument, like the violin, the higher its pitch. Therefore, the violin is the highest-pitched of the four, while the double bass is the lowest.</p>
                <p>Having these four instruments with different pitches in an orchestra creates harmony and evokes different emotions depending on the desired tone.</p>
                <p>There are also other types of string instruments. In classical music and orchestras, we often find the harpsichord and piano.</p>
                <p>Specific to European music, harpsichords reached their peak and inspired a vast repertoire during the 17th and 18th centuries, before falling out of favor throughout the 19th century. They have gradually regained popularity among musicians and audiences since the early 20th century.</p>

                <br>
                <p>The piano, much more recognized in modern orchestras and as a solo instrument, belongs to the struck string instruments. It is therefore an intermediary between string instruments and percussion.</p>

                <h3>Wind Instruments</h3>
                <p>There are two main categories of wind instruments:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Woodwinds, with characteristic instruments like the clarinet, oboe, and bassoon in an orchestra.</li> 
                    <img src="clarinette.jpg" alt="woodwind instruments in classical music" width="25%" height="100%">
                    <li>Brass, with characteristic instruments like the horn, trombone, and tuba in an orchestra.</li> 
                    <img src="cuivre.jpg" alt="brass instruments in classical music" width="25%" height="50%">
                </ul>
                <p>The wind family adds a lyrical effect to melodies.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>Percussion Instruments</h3>
                <p>Percussion is an essential element of modern orchestras, with a wide range of instruments creating various sounds and rhythms.</p>
                <p>The percussion family dictates the rhythm of the piece and gives it impact.</p>
