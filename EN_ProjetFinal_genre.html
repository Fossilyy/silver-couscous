                <h3>Baroque</h3>
                <p>From 1600 to 1750, baroque music featured complex polyphonies, contrasting sounds and expressive compositions Music before baroque was often a more exclusive art, tied to religious worship or courtly entertainement. Notable composers include Johann Sebastian Bach and Antonio Vivaldi.</p>
                <p>Baroque music is detailled and ornate, its sounds often contrasting with each other. Baroque compositors use a wide range of forms like the fugue, the suite and concerto grosso</p>

                <h3>Classical</h3>
                <p>The classical era (1750–1820) emphasized balance, clarity, and structure. Where baroque seeks abrupt contrast, classical music's transitions are gradual. Famous composers include Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Joseph Haydn.</p>
                <p>If Baroque is about rich complexity and ornate detailling, classical music prides itself in graceful simplicity. Its forms are more clearly defined and standardized.</p>

                <h3>Romantic</h3>
                <p>Between 1820 and 1900, romantic music prioritized emotion and individuality. Classical music was symmetry, structure and control, romantic music is unbridled, often consciouly pushing or breaking the forms established by its predecessor. Notable composers include Ludwig van Beethoven and Pyotr Tchaikovsky.</p>
                <p>Romantic music is a celebration of individuality and emotional depth, it wants to think about imagination, personal expression and nature. With romantic music, we return to more complex compositions like in baroque, but retain a more harmonious ensemble.</p>

                <h3>Modern</h3>
                <p>Starting in the 20th century, modern classical music explored innovation and experimentation, sometimes fragmenting of even abandoning the melody to favor texture or rythm. Its preferred themes are societal change and abstraction. Prominent figures include Igor Stravinsky and Philip Glass.</p>
                <p>A striking feature of modern music is its deliberate use of dissonance. Modern music seeks to innovate and one of the way it does so is using notes that seem to not go very well together and irregular rythms. That is the whole interest of it though, that despite the dissonance, the overall result is still harmonious with itself.</p>
