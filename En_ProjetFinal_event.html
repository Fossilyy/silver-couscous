                  <p>
                    French music, which shone throughout Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries, gave birth to successive genres with bold forms that are a testament to this heritage: court air, court ballet, comédie-ballet, tragedy in music, opera-ballet, grand and small motet, opéra-comique… The names of Rameau, Charpentier, Lully, Bouzignac, Marais, Campra, Mondonville, Dauvergne, and Grétry, among many others, reflect the extraordinary artistic effervescence of this period.<br/>
